If we matched on a dating app and you found this page while trying to vet me, you came to the right place. However, if you are a friend, colleague, or anyone else, you may wonder why this page exists.


## Why, seriously, why?

Whether we admit it or not, many of us will do a quick google/social media search of someone we've met on a dating app before meeting them. When done to verify the person's identity and check if they don't have any massive red flags, this is often a positive thing. 
Since I don't use social media, it can be difficult for anyone to verify that I exist, much less look for red flags. I have even been on a date with someone who admitted she and her roommate couldn't find any information about me online! 

While searching for tips on creating a good dating app profile, I read an article about people sharing "Date Me Docs" on Google Docs and personal websites like this. I thought this could be useful, even though I don't like the Silicon Valley "rationalists" that started it. Now you get the Facebook stalking experience but without Facebook.

## Who am I looking for?

I have difficulty explaining why, but I find intelligent, curious, knowledgeable, and passionate women especially attractive.
