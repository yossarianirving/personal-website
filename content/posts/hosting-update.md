Due to reliability issues with Cloudflare Tunnel, I have decided to take the boring route and host my webpage on Github Pages. Right now, the biggest hurdle I'm facing in self-hosting is my own reluctance to pay for a publicly facing IP address for my house. While I'm confident my pfsense firewall will prevent anything nefarious from getting in, I'm not comfortable with the privacy impacts of that setup.
I've explored using a cloud-based VM and VPN to tunnel incomming requests, but my ISP's peering agreements make that solution suboptimal.
