Now that I am searching for jobs, now is an excellent time to update you on the personal projects I have worked on for the past few months. These posts will provide insight into my thought processes and odd collection of skills and interests.

First on the docket is my sporadic, multi-year journey into DIY 3D pictures and videos. Unlike traditional 3D media that uses two synchronized cameras, I am attempting to use just one camera. The first technique uses a custom-made filter for a specific lens to produce anaglyphs with just a single click of the camera. The second technique uses a psychophysical phenomenon known as the Pulfrich effect to trick the human brain into interpreting a standard 2D video as three-dimensional. Finally, I'll demonstrate a third technique that uses a simple script to combine elements of the first two techniques. As a side note, I am in discussions with a local business about using what I've learned as part of a small social media marketing campaign.

Next, I want to clarify my stance on AI-generated "art" and why it doesn't fit my conception of art. In short, AI-generated content comes out of the box fully reified. It starts as a cultural dead-end with a fixed meaning and no room for reinterpretation. This contrasts with human-made art, which, while it undergoes reification over time, doesn't have a fixed meaning and still maintains a degree of non-conceptuality. The ability of art to change meaning over time and invoke difficult-to-describe emotions is what I find so compelling, and I don't believe anything created by a machine has that quality. In the full post, I'll expand on the philosophy behind my reasoning and make a few (crude) thought experiments that support my position.

Finally, for the recruiters and hiring managers reading this, I promise I will not use generative AI to rewrite my resume or generate duplicitous cover letters. The trend among job applicants using ChatGPT and similar programs to create cover letters and resumes is becoming a classic example of the commons dilemma. While I understand that the job hunt involves significant competition, I strive to be honest and approach opportunities in good faith. Due to my circumstances, I am comfortable taking this stance, but I empathize with those who feel they cannot do the same.
